    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p> 
        Iâ€™m a 22 year old guy from a town in Wantage, who moved to Coventry to study Mathematics at the University of Warwick. Having spent 3 years there hurting my brain, I thought I would give my brain a little rest and take a gap year volunteering for my Church and helping with the homeless. Well lockdown hit and so when the year ended I was eager to get back into hurting my brain. Hello School of Code!
